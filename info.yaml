UNTIL NOW!\nPretend to be him and steal his wisdom here: 73dde216.quals2018.oooverflow.io:31337\n\nAdam Doup√©, the famous cybersecurity professor and hacker, would like you to know that he is not responsible for the creation of this challenge, and that this is all Zardus' fault.\n\nThis service is heavily resource-constrained in a way that is impossible to scale. After solving a hard POW, you will be placed in a queue. To reduce frustration with the more routine aspects of interacting with the service, we have provided a queue-less (and flag-less) practice target: 17470319.quals2018.oooverflow.io:31337"
